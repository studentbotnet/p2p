LogMeIn Hamachi for Linux User Guide
=====================================

About LogMeIn Hamachi

	LogMeIn Hamachi is a virtual networking service that can be set up in
	minutes and enables secure remote access to your business network 
	anywhere there is an Internet connection.

	Unlike traditional hardware and software based VPN systems, LogMeIn
	Hamachi is an on-demand virtual networking service that allows you to
	focus your time and energy on providing the remote connections your 
	users and systems need, and not the technology or infrastructure you 
	are using to support them.

	For more information, visit 
	https://secure.logmein.com/US/products/hamachi2/

	
System Requirements

	LogMeIn Hamachi only requires Internet connection and you must have LSB
	version	3.0 or later installed.

	
Quick Start

	To install LogMeIn Hamachi and join a network, do the following:

	1. Depending on your distribution, install LogMeIn Hamachi as described in
	   the Installation section.

	2. Run 'hamachi login' to set the daemon online and to create an account.

	3. Optionally, run 'hamachi set-nick <nickname>'. Unless you select a
	   nickname, other Hamachi peers will see your client name as blank.

	4. Run 'hamachi join <network id>' to join a network.

	5. Run 'hamachi list' to list network members and their status.

	
Installation

	The Hamachi Linux client comes as a single executable binary
	(/opt/logmein-hamachi/bin/hamachid) compiled for the platform of your choice.
	This binary includes the Hamachi daemon, the control application, and
	the setup utility.

	You can install LogMeIn Hamachi in multiple ways depending on your Linux
	distribution. You can install LogMeIn Hamachi with RPM, DEB, and from a
	compressed file. 


	RPM installer

	The RPM installer supports Linux distributions, such as
	such as the Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Fedora Project, SUSE Linux 
	Enterprise, openSUSE, CentOS, and Mandriva Linux.

	To install LogMeIn Hamachi with the RPM installer, run the following command
	from the root account:

		rpm -i <LogMeIn Hamachi RPM installation filename>

	Optionally, you can double-click on the installation package to start the
	installation process.


	DEB installer

	The DEB installer supports Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Elive, 
	Linespire, and Knoppix.

	To install LogMeIn Hamachi with the DEB installer, run the following command
	from the root account:

		dpkg -i <LogMeIn Hamachi DEB installation filename>


	Compressed file installation

	To install LogMeIn Hamachi from a compressed TGZ file, run the following
	command from the root account:

		./install.sh

	
Starting and Stopping the Hamachi Daemon Manually

	After installation, LogMeIn Hamachi starts up as a background process
	(daemon) automatically. However, if you want to change the configuration
	of the Hamachi daemon, you can start and stop LogMeIn Hamachi manually
	and then control this process from the command line. 
	
	To start the Hamachi daemon, run:

		/etc/init.d/logmein-hamachi start

	To stop the daemon manually, run:

		/etc/init.d/logmein-hamachi stop

	
Starting the Hamachi Client

	After the daemon is started, you can control the Hamachi client from the
	command	line as follows:

		hamachi [command]
	
	When you run the daemon for the first time, it stays offline. To change
	its status to online, run:

		hamachi login

	To change its status back to offline, use:

		hamachi logout

	Running the Hamachi daemon without an argument displays the daemon's
	status:

		version    : 2.0.0.8
		pid        : 956
		status     : logging in
		client id  : 087-125-763
		address    : 5.50.1.2
		nickname   : buddy
		lmi account: buddy@net.com
	
	Note that the daemon remembers its state when it is shutdown with
	the 'stop' command. So if its state was online, it will automatically
	go online when started next time. If it was offline, it will stay
	offline.
	
	
Hamachi Client Commands

	After you have logged in, you can list the available Hamachi operations
	with the following command:
		
		hamachi -h
	
	The following network operations are available:

	For detailed description of the Hamachi client commands, see the
	following sections.
	
	
Joining Hamachi Networks

	You can join networks using the 'hamachi join' command. You will be 
	prompted for the password if it is not specified with the command.

	To join a network that requires manual approval of the owner, use the 
	'hamachi do-join' command.
	
	
Creating and Managing Your Hamachi Networks
	
	You can also create your own networks using the 'hamachi create' command.
	You will become an owner of any network that you create and only you
	will be able to delete these networks with the 'hamachi delete' command.
	
	With the 'hamachi evict' command, you can remove unwanted members from 
	the networks that you own.
	
	Note that you will stay online in the network after you create or
	join it. To go offline in the network, use the 'hamachi go-online' 
	command.

	Two other commands, 'hamachi go-offline' and 'hamachi leave', reverse
	the effect of the 'hamachi go-online' and 'hamachi join' commands 
	respectively.

	Note that the daemon remembers your network state. If you logout or 
	shutdown the daemon while being online in a network, the daemon will 
	automatically put you back online in the network on the next logon.
	

Attaching Your Client and Networks to a LogMeIn	Account

	You can attach your client to a LogMeIn	Account with the 'hamachi attach'
	command. This command sends an attach request to the LogMeIn account
	holder who must approve or reject your request. Until the LogMeIn account
	holder sends a response, you can cancel your request with the 'hamachi
	cancel' command. 
	
	If you want to attach your client with all the networks that you have 
	created on the client, use the 'hamachi attach-net' command.
	
	
Listing Peers

	To view the list of all networks and their members, run:

		hamachi list

	Network IDs are enclosed in square brackets and the network names are in 
	apostrophes. For gateway networks, the IP of the Hamachi network adapter
	and network mask is also displayed. The asterisk (*) in front of the 
	network name means that you are online in that network:

	* [023-715-571]  'abcde'
	* [system.gw]		 [192.168.4.3/24]
	    091-123-894  george  5.11.12.2
	* [homelan]   
	  * 087-455-651  chris   5.10.0.15    direct      UDP    65.49.88.5:7650
	  x 095-157-685  ronny   5.10.0.16    direct      UDP    45.234.5.1:1045
	    095-571-486  jane    5.10.0.17    direct      UDP    97.34.3.7:3450
	  * 096-654-987  jill    5.10.0.18    via-relay   UDP    144.6.89.12:5100
      
	Under the network name, there is a peer list. Online peers will have
	their IP address prefixed by an asterisk (*) or an (x). 

	(*) means that the tunnel to the peer is either being established or
	    ready. In the latter case, the peer's tunnel address is shown 
	    on the right side of the list.

	(x) means that the peer in unreachable, because the mediation server 
	    either failed or is still trying to establish p2p tunnel between you
	    and the peer.

	The first column of the peer list contains the nine-digit peer client ID.
	
	The second column contains the nickname of the peer.
	
	The IP address in the third column denotes the Hamachi IP address of the
	peer that is used to connect to other peers.

	The connection type of the peer is marked in the next column as follows:

	direct:      Other peers can make direct peer-to-peer connection, which is 
		     the fastest connection type.
	via-relay:   There is no direct connection between peers. Instead, peers 
		     connect to the dedicated relay server that handles connection
		     and transfers packages to the peers.
	via-server:  Peers cannot establish connections to relay servers and
		     therefore packages are transferred via the server connection. 
		     This is the slowest connection type.

	The next column indicates whether the peer can establish UDP or TCP 
	connection.

	The last column contains the physical IP address of the peer (if known)
	that Hamachi uses to establish connection between the peer and the
	Hamachi network adapter.



Listing Peer Properties
	
	To list peer properties, enter the following command:

		hamachi peer <client id>

	You see the following list of peer properties:

		client id  : 087-455-651
		nickname   : chris
		connection : direct
	
		authentication : completed
		encryption     : enabled
		compression    : disabled
		VPN status     : ok
		address        : 65.49.88.5
	
		via server  ok       TCP  n/a  
	      * direct      ok       UDP  192.168.2.123:61200

	These peer properties contain similar information to those that you see 
	in the peer list. The 'VPN status' field denotes whether the Hamachi
	virtual adapter is configured correctly, while the 'address' field 
	contains the Hamachi virtual IP address of the Hamachi peer. The
	'direct' line contains the physical IP address of the Hamachi peer.

	The last two lines show the connection to the peer. The active connection 
	is marked with an asterisk.


Listing Network Properties

	To get detailed information about a specific network, enter the following
	command:

		hamachi network <network id>

	You see the following list of network properties:

		id       : 091-123-894
		name     : abcde
		type     : Gateway

		VPN status  : ok
		IP address  : 192.168.1.33/22

		config      : static
		start ip    : 192.168.84.1
		end ip      : 192.168.84.254
		netmask     : 255.255.255.0
		def gateway : 192.168.84.1
		domain      : home.hamachi
		dns server  : 192.168.84.1
		            : 192.168.84.2
		remote net  : 192.168.20.0/22
		            : 192.168.200.0/22


	Network properties contain similar information to peer properties. The 
	network type can be Mesh, Hub-and-Spoke, and Gateway. If the network is 
	of gateway type and has static configuration, additional information is 
	also displayed about start and end IP range, DNS servers, remote 
	networks, the default gateway and domain name. Gateway networks with 
	DHCP configuration do not contain additional information.

	For those networks that were created on the client, an 'Owner' field is
	also displayed. This field contains the client ID of the owner of the 
	network.


Changing Nicknames
	
	You can change your own nickname with the 'hamachi set-nick' 
	command when you are online.


Changing Network Passwords

	To change the password of a mesh network that you created enter the
	following command:

		hamachi set-pass <network id> [<password>]

	There are no password strength requirements in LogMeIn Hamachi.


Managing Network Access

	To set the access of a network that you have created on the Hamachi
	client, enter the following command:

		hamachi set-access <network id> [lock|unlock] [manual|auto]

	To prevent clients from joining your network, use the 'lock' 
	option:

		hamachi set-access 023-715-571 lock
	
	In this case, join reqests will be automatically rejected.

	To enable new members to join your network, use the unlock option 
	on a locked network. This is the default setting, therefore all new 
	networks can accept new members.

	To approve the join request of new members, you can choose manual and 
	automatic approval:

		hamachi set-access 023-715-571 manual

	Clients that are waiting for manual approval to join your network are
	listed with a question mark (?) in front of the client ID.

	To accept a join request, you must define the client that you want to 
	accept and the network that the client wants to join to:

		hamachi approve <network id> <client id>


Configuring Gateway Networks

	To configure a gateway network, you must set the method of distributing
	member IP addresses. The network can either use a DHCP server for 
	assigning IP address automatically or can assign static IP addresses 
	from a pool to the members. Using static configuration is recommended 
	for gateway networks with no DHCP server.

	For networks using a DHCP server, you do not have to 
	configure an IP range, domain name, or DNS server IP addresses.
	For networks using static configuration, you must set network
	parameters with the following in mind:

		- [net <start ip> <end ip> <netmask> <default gateway>] are 
		  mandatory network parameters.
		
		- The domain and DNS parameters are optional. You can change 
		  these later without defining the mandatory network parameters
		  again.
		
		- You can define a maximum of two DNS servers.

	You can add network subnets that are connected to this LAN. Other 
	Hamachi clients will be able to access these subnets via your Hamachi 
	gateway	client. You can add and remove an unlimited number 
	of network subnets to your gateway client with the 'gw-config add' 
	and 'gw-config del' commands:

		gw-config 054-234-456 add 192.168.200.0/22
