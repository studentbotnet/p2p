What's new in Hamachi 2?

Web Management Interface

Centralized management is well-known for other LogMeIn products, but
is a new concept for Hamachi. This radically changes the way the users 
can handle their virtual networks and we all know the benefits of it. 
Our aim is to gently push our current user base towards this new 
approach of network management and we do it two ways: 1) we keep 
supporting the old-fashined Hamachi mode (unattached) so we do not 
force our users to attach their clients to a web account and 2) we 
deliver the nice new features only with web management interface.
The web management interface of Hamachi is tightly integrated with 
LMI, so we can expect that our users will more likely start to use 
other LogMeIn products as well.


New network types

Hamachi used only one network topology, where every member is connected
to every other member (Mesh). We introduced two new network types 
mainly targeted for corporate users: 
Hub-and-Spoke: Only hubs are connected to every other member, spokes 
have connection to only hubs. This topology is typical in a corporate 
environment, where only server computers (hubs) have to be accessible 
for a typical workstation (spoke). 

Gateway: There is only one dedicated server (gateway) that opens up the 
entire corporate network to roaming members in a secure way. These 
roaming members are typically travelling agents or company managers 
with laptops, who should be able to access the company network 
resources from a downtown hotspot or from an airport, for instance.


Corporate oriented policies

From the web management interface you can apply strict rules on your 
Hamachi network members. You can allow them to access the user 
interface of their Hamachi client installed on their computer (full 
mode). Or you can have total control over them through the web 
management interface by switching them to view-only (restricted) or 
hidden (tiny) modes.


Reports

For a corporate user or IT-professional it might be relevant to monitor 
network activities. Who is online and when, who generates too big or 
too small traffic, etc.


Other familiar LMI features

Profiles: The well-known profiles can be used with Hamachi. You can 
share your networks and clients with other web management accounts 
easily and set their privileges. 
Install Links: You can invite anyone to your Hamachi networks by 
sending an installation link via e-mail. -
"My Networks" page: You can browse and access functions of your 
networks and clients similarly to what you do with your computers on 
the My Computers page
